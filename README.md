# CMD Tutorial
CMD, short for Command Prompt, is a command-line interpreter program available in Windows operating systems. It provides a text-based interface for users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. CMD allows users to execute various commands and perform a wide range of tasks, such as managing files and directories, running programs, configuring system settings, troubleshooting issues, and more.
 
With CMD, users can navigate through the file system, create, delete, and modify files and directories, execute programs and scripts, manage network settings, and access system utilities. It operates based on a command-line interface (CLI) paradigm, where users input commands as text and the system responds with text-based output.
 
CMD uses a set of commands, such as dir to list files, cd to change directories, mkdir to create a directory, and ping to test network connectivity, among others. Additionally, CMD supports batch scripting, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks by writing scripts that contain a sequence of commands.
 
CMD is widely used by IT professionals, developers, and power users who prefer working with command-line tools or need to perform advanced system operations efficiently. While Windows 10 introduced PowerShell as an advanced alternative to CMD, the Command Prompt remains a powerful tool for system administration and command-line tasks in Windows.
