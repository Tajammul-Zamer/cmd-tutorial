# CMD Tutorial
CMD, short for Command Prompt, is a command-line interpreter program available in Windows operating systems. It provides a text-based interface for users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. CMD allows users to execute various commands and perform a wide range of tasks, such as managing files and directories, running programs, configuring system settings, troubleshooting issues, and more.
With CMD, users can navigate through the file system, create, delete, and modify files and directories, execute programs and scripts, manage network settings, and access system utilities. It operates based on a command-line interface (CLI) paradigm, where users input commands as text and the system responds with text-based output.
